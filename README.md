## My process

### Built with

- React (CRA)
- Styled Components

### What I learned

I tried to use Styled Components with React in this simple project. I came to like Styled Components, it is nice aproach to styling pages, IMHO better than SASS/SCSS. I like using media query like nested part of CSS (but in this project is not necessary).
